## What is Bevy Vector Shapes?
Bevy Vector Shapes is a library for easily and ergonomically creating instanced vector shapes in [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).

## WARNING
Bevy Vector Shapes is in the early stages of development. You may encounter issues, but feel free to report them.

## Features
- Variety of built in shape types: lines, rectangles, circles, arcs and regular polygons.
- Traits to allow implementation of custom shape types.
- Supports various bevy rendering features: 2D and 3D pipelines, transparency, alpha modes, render layers, bloom.
- Canvas API for rendering shapes to a texture.
- Ability to draw textures on shapes, including canvas textures.
- Immediate and retained mode.
- Local anti-aliasing for smoother looking shapes.
- Optional billboarding for each shape type to ensure they are always facing the camera.
- Shapes of the same type and rendering configuration are fully instanced together.
- Compilation to wasm to run your projects in the browser.

## Usage
See basic usage below and the [examples](https://github.com/james-j-obrien/bevy_vector_shapes/tree/main/examples) for more details on all supported features.

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
// Import commonly used items
use bevy_vector_shapes::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
        // Add the shape plugin:
        // - Shape2dPlugin for 2D cameras
        // - ShapePlugin for both 3D and 2D cameras
        .add_plugins(Shape2dPlugin::default())
        .add_systems(Startup, setup)
        .add_systems(Update, draw)
        .run();
}

fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
    // Spawn the camera
    commands.spawn(Camera2dBundle::default());
}

fn draw(mut painter: ShapePainter) {
    // Draw a circle
    painter.circle(100.0);
}
```
